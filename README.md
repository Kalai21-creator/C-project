This project is a console-based Number System Converter implemented in C. It facilitates conversions between various numerical bases: binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. The program begins with a welcome screen that presents users with options to choose from different conversion types or exit the application. Once a user selects a conversion type, they are prompted to input a number corresponding to the chosen base, with validation checks ensuring that the input adheres to the rules for each numeral system.

The core functionality of the project is organized into multiple functions that handle specific conversion tasks. For each number system, there are dedicated functions to convert from that base to the others, including input validation to prevent erroneous entries. The program uses loops and conditional statements to process the input, perform necessary calculations, and display the results in a clear format. Overall, the project serves as an educational tool, providing users with a practical understanding of number system conversions while demonstrating fundamental programming concepts in C.
